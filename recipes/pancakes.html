<h1>Ingredients</h1>
<ul>
    <li>2/3 cup sweetened condensed milk</li>
    <li>1/2 cup evaporated milk</li>
    <li>1/3 cup half and half</li>
    <li>1 box French vanilla cake mix</li>
    <li>1 1/4 cup almond milk</li>
    <li>3 large eggs lightly beaten</li>
    <li>4 tablespoons vegetable oil divided</li>
    <li>1/2 cup whipped cream or as needed (optional)</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon or as needed (optional)</li>
</ul>
<h1>Directions</h1>
<ol>
    <li>Combine sweetened condensed milk, evaporated milk, and half and half in a small saucepan and set over medium heat. Bring to a boil, stirring constantly for 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool. This is a sauce, not a syrup, so consistency will be on the thinner side.</li>
    <li>Add cake mix, almond milk, eggs, and 3 tablespoons vegetable oil to a large bowl, and beat vigorously by hand for 2 minutes.</li>
    <li>Heat a large skillet or griddle over medium heat, and lightly coat with remaining vegetable oil. Add 1/4 cup of the batter for each pancake. Cook until edges begin to puff up, small bubbles appear, pop, and leave small holes, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip pancakes and cook until golden brown on the other side, about 2 minutes more.</li>
    <li>Serve pancakes warm with a drizzle of the tres leches sauce, a dollop of whipped cream, and sprinkle of cinnamon.</li>
